# Private Cloud Reporting and Monitoring

Auth0 provides [logs](/logs) that are accessible via the Dashboard of the Management API's [`logs` endpoint](/api/v2#!/Logs/get_logs).

You can also choose to send the data logged by Auth0 to an external service. To help with this, there are Auth0 extensions that support automatic log export to services like Sumo Logic or Loggly. The following is a list of Auth0 log export extensions currently available:

* [Auth0 Logs to Application Insights](/extensions/application-insight)
* [Auth0 Logs to Azure Blob Storage](/extensions/azure-blob-storage)
* [Auth0 Logs to Loggly](/extensions/loggly)
* [Auth0 Logs to Papertrail](/extensions/papertrail)
* [Auth0 Logs to Sumo Logic](/extensions/sumologic)
* [Auth0 Logs to Splunk](/extensions/splunk)
* [Auth0 Logs to Logstash](/extensions/logstash)
* [Auth0 Logs to Mixpanel](/extensions/mixpanel)
* [Auth0 Logs to Logentries](/extensions/logentries)
