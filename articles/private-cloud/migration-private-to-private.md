# Private Cloud to Private Cloud Migration

The migration process complexity depends on the Auth0 features you are currently using. The process consists of a migration requirements discussion with your Auth0 Technical Account Manager which results in a custom migration plan for your specific implementation as well as a technical validation. Auth0 provides guidance and consulting on the process with a personalized migration plan designed for minimal intervention from Auth0. 

After the migration is complete, your users will have to re-log in and all their sessions will be invalidated. Other impacts depends on features you are using and will be outlined in your migration plan.

The process does not vary much if you're environment is:

* Standard Private Cloud
* Managed Private Cloud - Auth0 hosted
* Managed Private Cloud - self hosted

## Migration requirements discussion

Your Technical Account Manager will work with you to understand the migration requirements and assess the appropriate migration method. The default migration method is to back-up and restore to a new private cloud, however we may recommend environment extend in some circumstances. 

## Migration plan

After the discussion is complete, we will provide you with a migration plan document that outlines the steps to follow. 

## Go / No Go decision

Following a review of the plan and a **Go** decision, your Auth0 Technical Account Manager will manage the commercial process and facilitate the handover to the Private Cloud Service Delivery Team.

## Complete migration steps

The Service Delivery Team will coordinate the onboarding of your new Private Cloud environment. Subsequently, you may start executing the migration steps detailed within the plan either on your own or by engaging Auth0 Professional Services.

Following the migration, you will have sufficient time and technical support to evaluate and test the migration.
