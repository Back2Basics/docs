# Private Cloud Migrations

There are three types of migrations that Auth0 supports for Private Cloud:

* [Custom domain migration](/private-cloud/migration-custom-domain)
* [Private Cloud to Public Cloud migration](/private-cloud/migration-private-to-public)
* [Private Cloud to Private Cloud migration](/private-cloud/migration-public-to-private)

The migration process in each case typically involves several phases and steps.
